included license file for more details about the copyright information.

===================
Building ecat tools
===================

The ecat folder should be put in parallel to other 4dfp source directory so
that the ecat tools can be built properly.

Unpack libecat7-1.5 and build this tool following the included instructions.
Only the first two steps for building libecat tool are needed, i.e. configure
and make. The last two steps, make install and ldconfig, were not required for
building the ecat tools needed for PUP.

Build the ecatto4dfp and ecat_header excecutable using the included makefile.

For some platforms, where "/bin/sh" is pointed to "/bin/dash" or some other SHELL that do not support "pushd" and "popd", you will need to edit the create_src.sh script in the unpacked libecat7 directory and change "#!/bin/sh" at the top to "#!/bin/bash" or some other SHELL that support "pushd" and "popd".
