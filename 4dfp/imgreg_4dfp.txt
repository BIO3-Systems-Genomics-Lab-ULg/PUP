Program:	imgreg_4dfp

Purpose:	compute affine image registration

Usage:	imgreg_4dfp image_file1 mask_file1 image_file2 mask_file2 t4file mode

Argument description:
image_file1	target image
mask_file1	target image mask (or "none")
image_file2	object image
mask_file2	object image mask (or "none")
t4file		ASCII listing of computed transform as 4 x 4 matrix
mode		32 bit operation control word

Operation: The transform, [T], is optimized so that object image
read at coordinates transformed by [T] most closely
matches the target. That is, the average over all x of the match between
I2([T]x) and I1(x) is optimized. imgreg_4dfp operates iteratively. The
stating value of [T] is read from t4file if one is present. Otherwise
[T] is initialized to the identiy matrix. The image matching metric
is evaluated at voxels for which both image masks are non-zero. Both
images are read by trilinear interpolation. The default image registration
metric ("gradient") is intended for cross-modal registration, i.e, 
for images with dissimilar contrast mechanisms. The default image matching
metric sampling interval 10 mm in all directions with gradual reduction
to 4 mm at later stages of iteration. The default parameter search
optimization algorithm is grid search, i.e., the parameters
are serially optimized one at a time.

 8192	enable parameter optimization by computation of the metric gradient
	in parameter space and inversion of the Hessian

Image format: all imput images must be 4dfp format.

Additional points: imgreg_4dfp and some related programs read critical
information (voxel size and center of rotation) from
the ifh file associated with each image. If this information is not in
the ifh file then standard default center assignments near the image array
center are made. It is not necessary that the target and object
images match in dimension or voxel size. However, the target mask must
match the target image and similarly for the object mask and image.
imgreg_4dfp can align images of very different orientation, e.g., sagittal
vs transverse, if the t4file is initialized appropriately.
