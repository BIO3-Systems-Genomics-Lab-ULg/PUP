Building ecat tools
===================

The ecat folder should be put in parallel to other 4dfp source directory so
that the ecat tools can be built properly.

Only the first two steps for building libecat tool are needed, i.e. configure
and make. The last two steps, make install and ldconfig, were not required for
building the ecat tools needed for PUP.
