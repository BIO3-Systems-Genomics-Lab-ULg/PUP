4dfp
=======

The 4dfp package is developed and maintained by Dr. Abraham Z. Snyder (azsnyder@wustl.edu) at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. This package is provided here for the convenience of PUP user. Please refer to Dr. Snyder (Avi) for any questions.

=============
Installation
=============

Use the included installation script make_nil-tools.csh to build the package. Prior to installation the following environmental variables should be set:

NILSRC: the location of the 4dfp package
RELEASE: the target location of executables, scripts, and supporting files

In addition, the variable OSTYPE needs to be set to "linux" to avoid compiling problems. "linux-gnu" is not recognized by some of the makefiles included in this package.

After setting the environmental variables, run the following command for installation:

./make_nil-tools.csh

The utility to handle ecat format data is included in the ecat folder and should be installed separately following the provided instructions in that folder.
